1.1: The program compiles and runs. It prints the string "Yo" twice.
 .a) No. The inner class still has access to private fields/methods.
 .b) Yes. Doesn't effect how the public methods are implemented.
 .c) Yes. Because a static nested class needs to be instantied like a 'top level' class.
          It doesn't have direct access to instance fields or methods because
          it isn't defined as 'part' of the object. Just as another static method
          associated with the outer01 class, whose job happens to be creating
          an instance of a class defined 'nested' inside the outer01 class.
 .d) Yes. "Yo\nYo\n".

1.2: C. Can't have a static field on an inner class.

1.3: B. "he is 25"
