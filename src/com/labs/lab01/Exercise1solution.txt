// Q#3 - When rerunning w.o 'this' in constructor.
Results in the 'name' field being null, because it is shadowed by the constructors parameter 'name' so the functions return 'null' due to casting it to a string.

// Q#4 - Then add 'this' to the line in 'sayHello()'
Same thing. Adding 'this' tells java that you want to look at the fields associated with the class on which the method is defined but this is still null.

// Q#5 - Whats the best naming choice?
I vote for the middle - Does not 'shadow' the name field. Make explicit call to the classes field. no ambiguity.
