// Q#3 - When rerunning w.o 'this' in constructor.
// Results in the 'name' field being null, so the functions return 'null' due to casting it to a string.

// Q#4 - Then add 'this' to the line in 'sayHello()'
// Same thing. Adding this tell java that you want to look at the fields associated with the class on which the method
// is defined. 'Explicitly demands the member-level scope'

// Q#5 - Whats the best naming choice?
// I vote for the middle - Does not 'shadow' the name field. Make explicit call to the classes field. no ambiguity.
